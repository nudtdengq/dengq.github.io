## Bio

I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science and Technology at National University of Defense Technology. Before that, I received my PhD in the School of Computer Science and Technology at National University of Defense Technology in 2019. I was also a visiting PhD student in the Computer Science Department at University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. 
My research interest are computer architecture and processing-in-memory accelerator.
My papers have been published in major conferences and journals, including TCAD, DAC, ICCAD etc.
